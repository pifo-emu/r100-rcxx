1.3.0.0
      how to activate hidden options, please contact selling-manager on skype  

1.3.0.1
     in this version is added cw cycle check, it's possible to activate it for each profile by:   
     DCW CYCLE_CHECK: YES
     with this mode on yes, should be fake dcw's dropped 
     this function is still under development and will be improved in next releases
     to avoid timeout while fake dcw dropped, would be possible to set more server first processed
     or timing as would be possible to find fast replacement for dropped dcw
     
1.3.0.9
     added back FREECCCAM
     syntax in config is as for r82 version

1.3.1.0
     added options:
     DCW SKIPCWC_EXCLUDE_SIDS_ACTIVE: YES
     DCW SKIPCWC_EXCLUDE_SIDLIST: 0123,0124,0125 
     
     if option SKIPCWC_EXCLUDE_SIDS_ACTIVE is set to YES, than sids from SKIPCWC_EXCLUDE_SIDLIST
     are excluded from SKIPCWC cycle - these sids are allowed also when checksum is ok and
     checksum option: DCW SKIPCWC: is set to YES 
     
     added options:
     DCW SKIPCWC_ONLY_SIDS_ACTIVE: YES
     DCW SKIPCWC_ONLY_SIDLIST: 0123,0124,0125 
     
     if option SKIPCWC_ONLY_SIDS_ACTIVE is set to YES, you can use SKIPCWC_ONLY_SIDLIST for sids, 
     which are not checked by checksum (SKIP), also when option DCW SKIPCWC: is set to NO    

1.3.2.1
     attention: changed syntax for skipcwc:
     removed: ENABLE SKIPCWC: YES/NO
     
     replaced with: DCW SKIPCWC: YES/NO
     
     removed obsolete: (examples in config)
     ECM_HEADER
     
     replaced with:  (headers with any length delimited with comma "," )
     
     DCW ECM_HEADER_ACTIVE: YES
     DCW ECM_HEADER_VALUES: 80308B078400,81308B078400
     
     example for 09C4 now valid:
     
        [SKYDE-09C4]
        CAID: 09C4
        PROVIDERS: 0
        PORT: 17026
        DCW SKIPCWC: YES
        DCW HALFNULLED : YES
        DCW CHECK: NO

        DCW ECM_HEADER_ACTIVE: YES
        DCW ECM_HEADER_VALUES: 8170A400,8070A400
        ECM CHECK LENGTH: YES
        ECM LENGTH: A7
     
     now possible to turn off cache_threshold for profiles by:  (faster processing)
     now not recommended to use cache threshold for profiles, rather ecm headers   
     
        CACHE_THRESHOLD_PROFILE ACTIVE: NO
     
     removed obsolete SMARTFILTER: (now easy skipcwc used automatically - fastest)
        
        SKIPCWC_CHECKSUM_TEST DISABLE_FIXED: YES

        REJECT_BAD_DCW ON_SKIPCWC: NO

        LOG_BAD_NDS_DCW ACTIVE: NO

        SHOW_ONLY_BAD_NDS_DCW ACTIVE: NO

        LOG_BAD_NDS_DCW TO_FILE: NO

        NDS_SMARTFILTER THECM: 0
        NDS_SMARTFILTER CLI_CCCAM: 0

        NDS_SMARTFILTER CLI_CAMD35: 0
        NDS_SMARTFILTER CLI_CACHE: 0
        
        removed after testing with bad results also options:
        
        REJECT_NDS_DCW_OLDER_VERSIONS ACTIVE: NO
        REJECT_NDS_DCW_OLDER_VERSIONS LOG: NO
        
        REJECT_SKIPCWC_OLDER ACTIVE: NO
        REJECT_SKIPCWC_OLDER LOG: NO
        
        REJECT_CAK7_OLDER ACTIVE: NO
        REJECT_CAK7_OLDER LOG: NO
        
     removed obsolete fast_accpet, now automatically processed:
     
        FAST_SKIPCWC_CAIDS ACTIVE: NO
        FAST_SKIPCWC_CAIDS VALUES: 0500,1811,FFFF,1863 
     
     changed in example config DCW SKIPCWC: NO for caid 0500:050F00  (there are good cheksum ok dcw processed, by testing)            

1.3.3.0
     added option : (example caids) 
        FAST_SKIPCWC_CAIDS ACTIVE: YES
        FAST_SKIPCWC_CAIDS VALUES: 0500,09C4,098C,1819,1811,1708,1709
     if this option is active and caid values are set , there is lowering cycling from 200 to 7
     for maximum performance

1.3.3.1
     now recommended to use SMARTFILTER all to 1 + ECM Headers in profiles
     thresholds back to 0, as for now it should to filter ecm headers

1.4.4.1
     added options:
        REJECT_SKIPCWC_OLDER ACTIVE: YES
        REJECT_SKIPCWC_OLDER LOG: NO
     when active, reject skipcwc caids from multics versions older as r80
     as on these versions is not filtering of bad skipcwc dcw's
     better for now remove old caches
         
1.5.5.1
     added options:
        REJECT_CAK7_OLDER ACTIVE: YES
        REJECT_CAK7_OLDER LOG: NO
     when active, reject skipcwc caids from multics versions older as r80
     as on these versions are not ecm headers, and providers sends some bad ecm's for cak7 caids
     better for now remove old caches
     
1.6.6.1
     added option SERVER CACHE_THRESHOLD: x (x=number) for each newcamd profile
     removed previous skyde_threshold,meo_threshold, zon_threshold
     now able to use this option for each newcamd profile
     if there is not added, means = 0 , then is valid common CACHE THRESHOLD: x  mode

1.7.7.1        
     added option FAST_ACCEPT_MODE ON: YES
     use this mode , only if you don't need more skipcwc caids, as there are hardcoded the following:
     09c4,098c,1811,1708,1709,0500
     in this mode is faster processing of dcw accept , without cycling and debug
     also in this mode is not active smartfilter
     it's recommended to use this mode, if it's enough for skip cwc caids above and
     when you are using also ECM_HEADER mode    

1.8.8.1
     added option ECM_HEADER ACTIVE: YES
     ecm header is first bytes of ECM , whom are not changed - before ecm data
     if this mode is YES , there are needed also folowwing parameters:
     ECM_HEADER DEBUG: NO   (YES/NO - possible to see rejected headers in debug page)
     ECM_HEADER COUNT: 2    count of ecm headers
     ECM_HEADER LENGTHS: 8,8    length of ecm header in numbers of characters in HEX value
     ECM_HEADER VALUES: 8170A400;8070A400    ecm headers always in 8 characters divided by comma,
     if headers are longer as 8 characters, each header divided by point-comma
     
     (above is example for 09c4)
     
     example for Polsat 1803:
     
     ECM_HEADER ACTIVE: YES
     ECM_HEADER DEBUG: NO
     ECM_HEADER COUNT: 3    (there are three ecm headers on values : 80008F078D 80308F078D 81308F078D)
     ECM_HEADER LENGTHS: A,A,A   (length of each header is 10 characters, in HEX value A)
     ECM_HEADER VALUES: 80008F07,8D;80308F07,8D;81308F07,8D  (values are always after 8 characters divided by comma (,)
     and each header is divided by point-comma (;)
     
     you can use shorter or longer ecm headers, for longer probably more ecm headers
     
     it's strongly recommended to use it for 09C4 as there is a big amount of bad ecm with the same length
     
     examples were added to multics.cfg attached
     
     example for OrangeSK:
     
     ECM_HEADER ACTIVE: YES
     ECM_HEADER DEBUG: NO
     ECM_HEADER COUNT: 14
     ECM_HEADER LENGTHS: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8
     ECM_HEADER VALUES: 81704D75;80704D75;81705B73;80705B73;81704373;80704373;81705177;80705177;81704773;80704773;81703D73;80703D73;81704D73;80704D73        

1.9.9.1
    
    added option AUTO_UPDATE ON: YES  (or NOT)
    with this option all updates are processed automatically to not bothering with manuall update
    updates are checked and if available processed in night from 2 - 5 Hours AM   

2. this version always need for start option -C (config file path) for some parsing , than ensure you always start it with 
   -C /path/to/config/configfile.cfg
   it's needed also when you are using default path : /var/etc/multics.cfg 
   
   put checksumkey and hwpairingkey to your config !!!
   
   put checksum and readme.txt files to config path !!!
   
   don't use non linux editors for your config files !!!
   
   after first start put down somewhere your HW PAIRING DATA !!!  - as after expiration not possible to get them back
   
   recommended: http://www.pspad.com/en/
   
   start this version as root user
   
   or from cron with sudo   (required for iptables)

2.0.0
    Use for mgcamd maximum 39 profiles, to avoid reconnections
    for cccam use maximum 60 profiles to avoid reconnections
    
    if it's possible, use low number of profiles as possible, for faster and better responses and
    also to avoid reconnections
    it's better to use profiles for viaccess 0500:...... and use there all provid
    the same for example seca 0100:64,6a,6c,.......
    use this grupping to minimalize amount of ports
    
    those 107 profiles in config example is only for development server testing
    
    you should select only caids what you will have sure working with reponses
    
    if you really need so much profiles, use them by newcamd, and for mgcamd and cccam max as above,
    or you can use more mgcamd and cccam ports to divide it 
    
2.0.1
    there were added parameters for SKY DE 09C4 for more clean processing, you can use them in config like this:
    
    DCW_MINTIME_SET MS: 150
    MINTIME: 150
    CACHE SKYDE_THRESHOLD: 2
    
    these parameters are not valid for each profile, but as common
    should be written to above profiles 

2.0a
    starting from rc20 there is possible to use start option -D 1
    when this option is used, it's possible to use any character for user/password, also character #
    to acoid any problems, it's better when using of, remove comments with #
    example of using:
    /usr/local/bin/multics -D 1 -b -C /usr/local/etc/multics/multics.cfg
    
2a. 
   CUSTOM STRING ID_CACHE: YourString
   
   maximum 31 characters, possible to use also for masking as any other versions (not recommended, only on request by some users)

2a.1.0
    
    MASK_AS HB_VXX: 0
    
    also possible to use for masking as HB any version, if 0 it's turned off (not recommended, only by request of some users)
    
2a.1.1
    for maximum performance , use exactly values from multics.cfg
    
    you can set by this parameter your custom string showed on multics web pages, your nickname or servername or others...
    #Custom string visible on Web pages with version of multics (first char has to be -)
    CUSTOM STRING: -My-Version
    
   LOADAVERAGE RESTART: 300
    
    restart multics , if loadverage is over set value and system is overloaded 
    
    EMAIL INFO: my_email@gmail.com
    
    it's possible to set email in config, it's used for auto generating of scripts, if email is not set, in scripts 
    is set example@gmail.com
    
    in this version is added complete system for handling errors and threads auto-correction
    thse parameters in config are possible to set:
    
    RESTART_ON SIGTERM: NO
    RESTART_ON SIGHUP: NO
    RESTART_ON SIGABRT: NO
    RESTART_ON SIGSEGV: NO
    
    those parameters means , when signalis raised , it's possible to set restart action on , or to block it
    when parameters are set on NO and signals are blocked, it starts auto-correction system 
    if this system is not possible to handle error and reset the signal ,it's processed force restart 

    RESTART_ON SIGTERM: YES
    RESTART_ON SIGHUP: YES
    RESTART_ON SIGABRT: YES
    RESTART_ON SIGSEGV: YES
    
    if parameters are set to YES, when signal is catch, it's processed immediatelly restart 
    
  with parameters below is possible to set start of a script defined, on catched signal :
    
  RUN_SCRIPT_ON SIGTERM: /mnt/rd/x/etc/multics6/sendmail_on_sigterm_multics6.sh
  RUN_SCRIPT_ON SIGHUP: /mnt/rd/x/etc/multics6/sendmail_on_sighup_multics6.sh
  RUN_SCRIPT_ON SIGABRT: /mnt/rd/x/etc/multics6/sendmail_on_sigabrt_multics6.sh
  RUN_SCRIPT_ON SIGSEGV: /mnt/rd/x/etc/multics6/sendmail_on_sigsegv_multics6.sh
  
  these scripts are automatically generated to config path, they are rewritten on each restart
  than when you need another script , you can copy/modify/ these ones
  
  and set them as upper, to location/name
  
  default generated script is for sending email on signal, for this you need to has set-up mail and ssmtp config
  for sending with gmail
  
  how to set-up email on ubuntu:
  
  https://vitux.com/how-to-use-gmail-from-the-ubuntu-terminal-to-send-emails/
  
  if there is another app for ubuntu for email (those generated is for mail on gentoo),
  you can existing script copy/modify/rename/set as new one   

2.0.0
  MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE TUNNING
  
  added start parameters for maximum performance cycling for MAX_CSPORTS , SHARELIMITS and CACHE_VALUE
  
  now is possible to add on start these parameters to commandline:
  
  -M 95  it's maximum csports value default : 200 - this value, you can set it by your profiles count like this:
   200 is default value hardcoded
   (200-your_profiles_count + 2 as reserve)  
   example : profiles count is 40
   value should be : -M 158   (means, you will set value 200-158 = 42 )    
   
  -S 50  it's sharelimits value default : 100 - this value, you can set it by your sharelimits count like this:
   100 is default value hardcoded
   (100-your_sharelimits_max_value_used )  
   example : maximum sharelimits value used is 50
   value should be : -M 50   (means, you will set value 100-50 = 50 )
   
  -X 45  it's cache value (how many profiles are serve by cache) default : 150 - this value, you can set it by your profiles count like this:
   150 is default value hardcoded
   (150-your_profiles_count + 2 as reserve)  
   example : profiles count is 40
   value should be : -M 108   (means, you will set value 150-108 = 42 )
   
   binary start with parameters example:
   
   /root/projects/Multics-PrivBuild-BrokenArrow/bin/multics -M 95 -S 50 -X 45 -b -C /mnt/rd/x/etc/multics_test/multics_test.cfg

2.0.1
  DENY SIDS FIX
  there was added parameter :
  
  SID DENYLIST: SID1,SID2 ....
  
  it's possible set priority to SID LIST or to SID DENY LIST by parameter :
  
  SID PRIORITY: 1
  
  if this parameter is not set , default is 1 , what means , that SID DENYLIST has always priority
  if this parameter is set to 0 , priority has SID LIST
  
  valid , if there are used both lists

2.0.2
  added posibility for cache identification to mas as HB32 version
  
  to activate this, put to the config:
  
  MASK_AS HB_V32: YES  

2.0.3
  added new parameter for SMART FILTER to block dcw's from old versions of Multics or untrusted versions     
  it's not only NDS, but also valid for 09c4,1810,0b00
  
  REJECT_NDS_DCW_OLDER_VERSIONS ACTIVE: YES
  REJECT_NDS_DCW_OLDER_VERSIONS LOG: NO  

2.0.4
  added new parameter for blocking of Multics HB versions 33 and above, because of bad dcw caches abuse and
  untrusted users's security 
  
  #auto disable HB versions HB33 and above, for caches abuse with bad DCW for 09c4,1810,0b00
  AUTO_DISABLE_HB_VERSIONS ACTIVE: YES
  
  if this parameter is set to YES, go to the cache page, after that should be starting to add to config to records of CACHE PEER: 
  on begining of the line :
  
  #BLOCKED_HB_VERSION:

  than process SAVE on Editor page and those caches should be removed

2.1
  
  for testing purpose only !!!
  
  may cause falling !!!
  
  keep values as they are , if you are not using watching testing and there are running big amount of requests !!! 
  
  LOADBALANCER
  added parameters for Loadbalancer:   (experimental , for low servers , rather use default , what is by values lower:)
  
  working only on low level servers, otherwise may cause falls > srv->busy , 
  than don't use higher values on very big and fast servers
  there is also hardcoded protection to non active , if servers more as this parameter and if totl ecm per minute higher as 1000
  
  LOADBALANCER MAX_SERVERS: 0   #MAX value is 50
  
  selecting fastest server for ecm answer , enable only for watching , or very low servers total ecm per minute and servers lines

  LOADBALANCER FASTEST_SERVER_FIRST: NO
  
  max ecm time for fastest server:
  
  LOADBALANCER FASTEST_MAXIMUM_ECM_TIME: 600
  
  loadbalancer active after count of ecm ok (valid also for VALIDECMTIME):
   
  LOADBALANCER INIT_AFTER_ECMOK: 10
  
  time for users are moving between connected and active (valid also for VALIDECMTIME)
  
  LOADBALANCER ACTIVE_VALUE: 20000
  
  if this parameter is set, there can be set VALIDECMTIME to lower value, for example to 800
  when no server is find in table for this value , it raise value for next cycle with parameter TWO_PLUS_MILISECONDS ,
  than with THREE_PLUS_MILISECONDS , than with FOUR_PLUS_MILISECONDS and than with  FIVE_PLUS_MILISECONDS
  
  LOADBALANCER CYCLES_ACTIVE: NO
  LOADBALANCER TWO_PLUS_MILISECONDS: 350
  LOADBALANCER THREE_PLUS_MILISECONDS: 500
  LOADBALANCER FOUR_PLUS_MILISECONDS: 600
  LOADBALANCER FIVE_PLUS_MILISECONDS: 3000

2.2
  OSCAM FAKECWS
  
  added support for oscam.fakecws file , if this file is in config path, it's loaded on start
  than is processed to two of parts , one for ALL caids and second for only NDS caids and halfnulled dcw
  it's for btter speed , if it's using , as this file has 30K lines (fake dcw)
  
  activating for all - not recommended , checking with every ecm answer 30K fake dcws , only for very low level servers 
  recommended , also check if there are not higher values of ecm answers time response
  
  OSCAM_FAKE_CWS ACTIVE_ALL: NO
  
  activating only for NDS halfnulled dcw (09c4 and 098c caids) , recommended (only 241 lines processed with every dcw)
  
  OSCAM_FAKE_CWS ACTIVE_NDS: NO
  
  possible to set reverse comparing of fake dcw (experimental for testing)
  
  OSCAM_FAKE_CWS REVERSE: NO
  
  log to debug page console:
  
  OSCAM_FAKE_CWS LOG_ACTIVE: NO
  
  log to file in config path (oscam_fakecws_bad_dcw.log):
  
  OSCAM_FAKE_CWS LOG_TO_FILE_ACTIVE: NO
  
  remove log file after seconds (7 days if default 604800):
  
  OSCAM_FAKE_CWS LOG_FILE_REMOVE_AFTER_SECONDS: 604800
         

2b. NDS SMARTFILTER
  
  in this version was added nds smartfilter for bad dcw 09c4 and 098c caids
  you can use in config these parameters:
  
  #activating NDS SMARTFILTER
  REJECT_BAD_DCW ON_SKIPCWC: YES
  #check if dcw are 64bit
  CHECK_NDS_DCW IF_64_BIT: YES

  NDS_SMARTFILTER CLI_CACHE: 1
  
  experimental values, keep them as they are, if you don't want to test it and try to identify sources of bad dcw's

2c.
  Added Prameters Page
  
  to activate:
  
  HTTP PARAMETERS: YES
  
  there is possible to set parameters for Servers page multi-button to show :
  values : servers with percentage lower than : values from 0% to 100% 
  for values 0% and 100% it's set to equal
  for another values it's valid as lower than <= set values
  
  second line parameters Show Values In Range - there is possible to set range values
  for servers percentage
  from 0-10% up to 90-100%
  
  there were also added two parameters for config :
  
  with this parameter servers with 0% will be disabled 
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_SERVERS ZERO: YES
  
  time value in seconds for parameter above, after this time will be servers with 0% disabled
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_SERVERS ZERO_AFTER_SECONDS: 0
  
  you can enable all disabled servers on parameters page with button Disable/Enable =0%
  
  with this parameter servers with 0% - 10% will be disabled
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_SERVERS ZERO_TEN: NO
  
  time value in seconds for parameter above, after this time will be servers with 0% - 10% disabled
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_SERVERS ZERO_TEN_AFTER_SECONDS: 0
  
  you can enable all disabled servers on parameters page with button Disable/Enable =0%
  
  if time values in seconds parameters are set to 0 , they are disabled
  
  with these parameters will reconnection users set to monitoring on Parameters page in text area window
  
  Auto monitoring of fast reconnection users , causing network issues
  parameter - generic count, detect count of reconnection for any users:
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_BAD_RECONNECTION_USERS GENERIC_COUNT: 500
  
  user will be monitoring only after uniq count of this user:
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_BAD_RECONNECTION_USERS UNIQ_COUNT: 100
  
  monitoring is active (for newcamd - for now only newcamd is possible):
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_BAD_RECONNECTION_USERS NEWCAMD: YES
  
  user will be disabled after seconds of monitoring (first 300s disabled on start)  
  if this parameter is lower as 400 , only log there, without disabling - recommended
  
  AUTO_DISABLE_BAD_RECONNECTION_USERS NEWCAMD_SECONDS: 350
    

2d.
  added config AES256 encryption
  
  on VPS is possible to encrypt config file by parameter:
  
  ENCRYPT_CONFIG_FILE_ON_VPS ACTIVE: YES
  
  also on Parameters page with buttons Encrypt Config and Decrypt Config
  
  be aware with using of, always create backup of your config file , before using it !  

3. you can use function TURBOMODE - for activation add to config:
  HTTP TURBOMODE: ON
  
  TURBOMODE ACTIVE: YES
  now - by button on Turbomode menu
    
  description:
  This function speed up some processes , but be informed , using of cause counters are not actual.
  These cache counters are inaccurate:   Requests, Replies, Sent REQ, Sent REP
  also some debug functions are not used in this mode
  
4. Iptables
  
   after start/restart of multics , iptables are active after 5 minutes interval
   
   you can activate in http function Iptables by adding to config value:
   HTTP IPTABLES: YES
   
   now - by buttons on Iptables menu and on menus for cardservers
   
   by using them , you can flush iptables (reset to default state)
   and also by buttons restore cache, newcamd, mgcamd, cccam , cs378x iptables rules
   all are stored under config path directory, also for manual using 
   
   local network is allowed by reading of /etc/hosts file
   than for correct using of iptables , don't forget to write to this file all your local network servers
   
   for example:
   /etc/hosts
   127.0.0.1       localhost
   192.168.1.130   server1
   192.168.1.101   server2
   .
   .
   and so on ...
   
   also you can use iptabels for users , for newcamd, mgcamd, cccam , cs378x and cache
   to activate put to config:
   
   - now by using of buttons as above  (on menus of cardservers web pages)
   
  IPTABLES CACHE: ON
  IPTABLES NEWCAMD: ON
  IPTABLES MGCAMD: ON
  IPTABLES CCCAM: ON
  IPTABLES CS378X: ON
  IPTABLES SOFTMODE: ON
  IPTABLES FORCEMODE: OFF
  
  recommended for standard mode to use them turned OFF (ON only temporarilly , while are disabled unwanted access requests)
  
  if this parameter is set:    this mode has priority if both soft and force are set to YES or ON
  IPTABLES SOFTMODE: ON
  
  iptables are working in soft mode , in this mode are active only in set time interval
  if you still will have unknown cache peers and users requests after a very long time 
  you can use parameter temporarilly:
  
  IPTABLES FORCE: ON
  
  this will set iptables to hard mode and shortest time update 
  disable this parameter after filtering all unwanted requests and use as default soft mode
  
  in this version is used auto pooling for iptables and xtables lock management
  
  if you want to flush iptables on every start/restart of multics , you can use parameter:
  IPTABLES FLUSHONSTART: YES
  
  default is better to set it to NO , if you need flush iptables, you can do it from menu manually
   
   it's not recommended to use iptables in full time 
   better is , if you have a many unwanted calls to cache and others 
   to activate them for a example 10 minutes , IPTABLES CACHE: ON
   than when it completely processed disable them 
   than for newcamd ... mgcamd ... and others
   
   all iptables commands are stored to log files and bkp files under config path directory
   it's possible to restore them by buttons on menu Iptables
   
   cs378x is not recommended to use either , as it's experimental
  
  you can disable all of them with OFF
  if those are activated , all unknown users/clients and cache peers will be filtered (drop)
  you can check iptables by commands:
  iptables -L -n
  count of records:
  iptables -L -n | wc -l
  only for some newcamd port , or others ports:
  iptables -L -n | grep 17000
  
  if you need allow some ip (delete from iptables) , you can do that by this :
  get the number of record :
  iptables -L -n --line-numbers | grep 17000  (grep of port, or grep of ip)
  there you can see number for iptables record and you can delete it by :
  iptables -D INPUT 123   (123 is the number , put there your number which you want to delete)
  
  with using of Iptables_Flush from menu , local area network is allowed by adding it to top
  level of iptables (means it's added as INPUT  with parameter -I INPUT)
  
  users iptables records are added as append (means those records are added on end of iptables
  with parameter -A INPUT)
  
  for cache exchange disable temporarily IPTABLES CACHE: OFF
  as when you exchange, than you will provide your cache and than there will be request to connect from your 
  exchange user to your cache (you still don't know when and from), what causing , it will be dropped , when iptables cache are on.
  When you finished exchanging , you can enable iptables cache back.  
  
5. Control for cache hits
   on cache page there you can see level of hits per hour (Hits p/H)
   it's counted from start time and connected time 
   to control them you can use parameter in config:
   CACHE MINHITS: 360
   parameter is minimal count of hits per hour
   it's recomended to use minimal value 360 , as it's only 1 hits per 10s
   to allow caches with lower value causing only worse parameters regarding to network (ping and others)
   all caches with lower value as CACHE MINHITS are marked with red color and you can disable them or 
   delete from config
   if you can use automatic system for this , you can use parameters to config:
   CACHE LOWHITS_AUTODISABLE_AFTERSECONDS: 0
   CACHE CHECK_INACTIVE_EVERYSECONDS: 0
   CACHE REMARK_INACTIVE_AFTERSECONDS_INACTIVITY: 0
   these functions are experimental and better is manually to disable unwanted,  but if you still want use them
   it's working as following:
   CACHE LOWHITS_AUTODISABLE_AFTERSECONDS: 0   (with 0 is disabled)
   set there your value , for example 14400  (4 hours)
   after 4 hours , if cache peer still have lower value as CACHE MINHITS , it will be disabled
   CACHE CHECK_INACTIVE_EVERYSECONDS: 0   (with 0 is disabled)
   inactive peers are checked every seconds interval , for example 14400 (4 hours)
   if still those peers are inactive , when it's checked , they will be disabled after :
   CACHE REMARK_INACTIVE_AFTERSECONDS_INACTIVITY: 0   (with 0 is disabled, set wanted value) 
   for example :
   CACHE CHECK_INACTIVE_EVERYSECONDS: 3600
   will check inactive peers every hour 
   CACHE REMARK_INACTIVE_AFTERSECONDS_INACTIVITY: 28800   (8 hours)
   if still on every one hour check is cache peer inactive , means that will be 8 checks still disabled
   it will be remarked in config as inactive with : 
   #AUTO-DISABLED ON INACTIVITY- xx.xxx.xxx.xx 12444 -AUTO-DISABLED ON INACTIVITY
   you can anytime activate it again with replacing to correct format manually
   if you want to force deactivate minhits control for cache peer , specially is needed for oscams local exchanges
   you can put to cache peer:   nominhits=1    parameter
   CACHE PEER: 192.168.1.101 59020 { csp=yes; nominhits=1 }
   or not csp peer:
   CACHE PEER: 192.168.1.20 59020 { nominhits=1 }
   
6. Nettunning - Network Tunning patch
   
   (soft  nofile  470000) auto added as parameter for binary pid on start (rc09)
   
   for older and no nofile parameters:  
    
   in these versions added : higher value for /etc/security/limits.conf
       *       soft  nofile  470000
   value: 470000
   this value is needed for opened file descriptors 
   these file descriptors are used by gethosbyname
   than , when you will have server lines more than 500 or 1000 , there will be hundreds of thousands opened file descriptors
   you can check amount of opened file descriptors by command lsof | wc -l
   if you have not istalled lsof command , on ubuntu it possible to install it by : apt install lsof
   if nettuning patch is applied , this value is written to /etc/security/limits.conf
   don't change this value to higher to very high values, only add a some thousands and test it
   because very high value may cause a serious unwanted states of server system
   this value of 470000 is tested for 1430 server lines and for this amount it's ok  
    
   you can use some special network parameters to tunning network for better performance
   to activate it on http: 
   HTTP NETTUNNING: YES
   if you will activate it by pressing on web , there will be applied patch for sysctl with these parameters
   these parameters are not persistence , and on every restart of server, they are default by sysctl.conf
   
   it's possible to revert this patch by button on menu Nettunning
    
   be carefull , test if not occured any disconnect issue, if yes, revert patch to default values by sysctl 
   
   now in this version , nettunning patch is possible to apply only once , again only after revert or restart of system
   
   than also from this reason , parameter in previous versions HTTP NETTUNNINGONSTART is now obsolete and not valid any more       
   
7. 098C and 09C4  - added : 1884, 1813, 1817, 1818 , some others 0500 ...
   there is built-in filter for these caids to skip cwc checksum test, no needed any other options in config
   you can exchange with any other multics versions , better massive caches as lines for 09c4 and 098c
   
   it's not recommended to exchange N lines for older multics versions which don't have skipcwc checksum < Multicsr82 CB
   caches you can exchange with any other version, also with r69 , r70 and others
   
   -- now possible to set ENABLE SKIPCWC: YES for each profile
   
   to activate :
   SKIPCWC_CHECKSUM_TEST DISABLE_FIXED: YES
   
   with this parameter are active values from config for each profile
   
   if this parameter is NO
   SKIPCWC_CHECKSUM_TEST DISABLE_FIXED: NO
   there are active default values hardcoded - use it, if you don't know which caids/provid would be set to skipcwc
   
8. Optimal configuration
   optimal configuration is up to 103 profiles , up to 300 caches and up to 2020 servers, as it was tested on
   development test server
   but any other parameters should be ok
   
   if you will have problems with stability or a disconnecting issue or others
   try to remark parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf
   let there only TCP KEEPALIVE :
   net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 259200
   net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 9
   net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 75
   
   restart server
   and try to run multics again
   
9. Minimal supported Ubuntu is >= 16.04
    
   if you have older , you can processed upgrade by:
   
   do-release-upgrade 

   Possible known issues:   error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.xx.xx.xx: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 
   try to fix it by:
   
   Ubuntu:
      
   install package: libssl-dev
   or
   install package: openssl-compat
   
   Debian and Ubuntu if not helpfull first step:
   
   https://packages.debian.org/jessie/amd64/libssl1.0.0/download
   
   cd /opt
   apt-get update
   apt-get install multiarch-support
   wget http://security.debian.org/debian-security/pool/updates/main/o/openssl/libssl1.0.0_1.0.1t-1+deb8u12_amd64.deb
   dpkg -i libssl1.0.0_1.0.1t-1+deb8u12_amd64.deb
   
   if problem still persist, continue as below:
   
   if still there is this issue (very old systems) , fix it by this process:
   
   if it's possible upgrade from very old systems by:
   
   do release upgrade
   
   or:
   
   first try:
   ubuntu:
   
   (only higher and >= 16.04 , older version issue GLIBC, also for compiled libcrypto.so.1.1 and libssl.so.1.1)
   
   apt update
   apt install openssl
   
   centos:
   
   yum install openssl
   
   if it's still this issue present , try this :
   
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install build-essential software-properties-common -y && \
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y && \
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install gcc-snapshot -y && \   
    sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install gcc-6 g++-6 -y && \
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-6 && \    
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 -y && \
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8
        
   or :     
        
   https://blacksaildivision.com/how-to-install-openssl-on-centos         (the same way also for ubuntu)
   
   start from this point :   (or use lib files attached in zip file)
   
   curl -O -L https://github.com/openssl/openssl/archive/OpenSSL_1_1_1c.tar.gz
   
   if all is installed , on old systems , find libssl.so.1.1 and libcrypto.so.1.1 (it would be in dir: /usr/local/openssl ) and copy them to: 
   /lib 
   /lib32
   /lib64
   
   than restart multics , it should fix this problem
   
   libcrypto and libssl problem 
   this version need libssl and libcrypto 
   than you need this installed on the system 
   if you will get message:  error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.xx.xx.xx: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   or/and
   error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.xx.xx.xx: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   try to install these packages  
   on ubuntu:
   apt-get update
   apt-get install openssl
   apt-get install libssl-dev
   if this problem still persist , you can create symbolic links to existing version:
   find / -name "libssl*"
   look on version name from /usr/lib64 or lib location and create symlink:
   ln -s /existing/version/libcrypto.xx.xx.xx /existing/version/libcrypto.rquired.version.xx
   the same for libssl 
   this should fix the problem
   
    libgomp issue : if you will find message like this :
    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    
    it's needed to install libgomp1 libraries:
    
    how to ubuntu:
    
    apt install libgomp1
    
    centos :
    
    yum install libgomp
      
                 
   Mega flush iptables problem 
   
   in this version is used xtables lock auto management pooling and this issue shoud be fixed
   
   if you have more - a hundreds of iptables records and/or more versions of multics's
   when on all you have active iptables ON and performing flush iptables
   there are massive requests to all multis's to run commands to write drop rules
   this causing multiple access to iptables binary , what may cause problems
   there is build-in protection , what are locking iptables , as multiple requests have to waiting to finish anothers
   but it's recommended :
   when you want run this mega flush of iptables , turn off iptables on all multics's except of first one 
   there turn of another except of cache iptables
   than perform flush iptables
   wait some time when all are processed
   than turn on also another , for example mgcamd, than , cccam and so on ...
   with the same way process for another multics , than another ...
   with this process , it should be ok       
   
10. this version is tuned for maximum performance on caches, than it's
    recommended to use more cache exchanges

11. it's recommended to use not symlinks for more multics's running on the same server, but instead of, use always copy of
    source binary , as it may sometimes need access to binary and on symlinks may cause problems

  
    IF YOU PLACE readme.txt file TO YOUR CONFIG PATH , it will appear o Info page automatically  

13. fixed issues:
    mgcamd / users signals - causing falls 
    cache / users signals - causing falls
    editor / removing servers - causing falls
    editor / removing cacheex servers - causing falls
    some iptables bug fixes
    fixed bugs from test version rc02
    fixed bug showing time on cache page
    enhancements:
    debug on config parse error showing full line to find it in config
    colorize, buttons, and others ...
    config backup every 5 min , every hour, every week , every 3 months ...
    threads protection
    parallelize improved
    skip cwc checksum test , from predefined hardcoded values , or from config  
    server loadbalancing for big amount of servers improved
    restart on loadaverage value possible to set from config
    email info on fall/restart  
    todo:
    check and fix for Total Hits and Total Replies on Cacheex page 
    
14. performed test:
    AMD Ryzen 3 (8core , 32GB RAM)
    1760 servers / lines
    134 caches (very powerfull)
